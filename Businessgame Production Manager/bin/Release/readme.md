# Businessgame Production Manager

BPM is an independent simulator tool written by one of our users, Wildjap. This simulator simplifies the set up and buying of units for creating a "closed system". This tool enables you to see what your production would look like with a certain company set up, without actually needing to have bought the units.

Once you have tweaked the numbers to a set up you like, the program allows you to automatically buy those missing units to achieve this company set up.

## Getting Started

Download the "Businessgame Production Manager.exe" file which you can find in the bin/Release folder of this git.

### Prerequisites

Only works on Windows.

## How to use

### Log in

Open the program and log in to businessgame by checking the checkbox "Display WebBrowser". This will open up a popup box that allows you to log in to the game. When you are logged in you can close the login box again by unchecking the "Display WbeBrowser" checkbox. You are now ready to start using the application.

### Load in your company settings

You can import your current company setup by using the "Load Private Data" button which, if you are logged on to businessgame, will automatically load how many units you have of each sector, how muc money you have, how much resources you have of each product and amount free space in warehouse.

### Testing new productions

Double click on one of the sector names on the left to change the amount of sectors you want to test. When you change the number the application will show you what your net production would be like.
